# Kubernetes

## Core Concepts

### Kubernetes Architecture

The Kubernetes cluster contains multiple nodes that host the applications.

We have multiple node types in a cluster:

- Worker Nodes: Host applicationa as containers
- Master Node: Manages, plan, schedule, monitor worker nodes

The master node uses a set of tools named control plane in order to orchestrate the applications on the worker nodes.

The master node holds the data in a highly available key-value store database. Usually `etcd`.

The master node uses the `kube-scheduler` to identify which app go on which worker node and when.

Kubernetes has various controllers that take care of different areas:

- Controller Manager:
  - Node Controller
  - Replication Controller, etc.

The `kube-apiserver` is the primary management component of Kubernetes. It is responsible for orchestration of all operations in the cluster.

Besides Docker, Kubernetes supports multiple other runtime engines:

- containerd
- rkt, etc.

Each worker node has an agent named `kubelet` that listens for instructions form the `kube-apiserver`, destroys or deploys resources as required. It also communicates with the `kube-apiserver` to report the status of the worker node.

Communication between worker nodes is made through the `kube-proxy` service.
It ensures that the necessary rules are in place to allow communication between containers as required.

### Docker vs ContainerD

Kubernetes exposes an interface named Container Runtime Interface (CRI) which allows various container runtimes developers to integrate with Kubernetes as long as they adhere to the Open Container Initiative (OCI). The OCI is composed of an `imagespec` and `runtimespec`.

- `imagespec`: Defines how an image is being built
- `runtimespec`: Defines how a container runtime should be developed

Initially, Docker was not made to support the CRI standard (since Docker was built long before CRI). Kubernetes introduced `dockershim` to support Docker as a container runtime.

To address this workaround that Kubernetes developed, Docker build `containerd` to integrate directly with Kubernetes CRI.

Since Kubernetes v1.24 Kubernetes decided to remove `dockershim`. The integration with Docker now uses only `containerd`.

Even though it was initially developed by Docker, ContainerD is now a separate project and a member of CNCF with the graduated status. This means now you can install ContainerD on its own without installing Docker.

You can still run containers directly with ContainerD through its CLI tool named `ctr`. `ctr` is not user friendly and supports limited features directly.

**`ctr` was designed for debugging purposes.**

An alternative to `ctr` is `nerdctl` which is more user friendly and has quite a lot of features and acts more as `docker` command than `ctr`.

There is also `crictl` command that is developed by Kubernetes community and provides a CLI for the CRI compatible container runtimes. This is also a debugging tool.

Example of commands for `crictl` (most of them are similar to `docker`):

- `crictl pull busybox`
- `crictl images`
- `crictl ps -a`
- `crictl exec -i -t 324lkskdjfwnlsfkjlzkjdf3423 ls`
- `crictl logs 324lkskdjfwnlsfkjlzkjdf3423`
- `crictl pods` - `crictl` also has access to Pods.

### ETCD

ETCD is a distributed, reliable key-value store that is Simple, Secure & Fast.

A key-value store is similar to JSON or YAML format where there are keys (usually name of variables) and their respective values separated by a delimiter.

To install ETCD you just need to download the binaries, extract it and run.

By default, `etcd` listens on port 2379.

`etcdctl` is a CLI client that interracts with the `etcd` service.

Some sample commands for API v2 are shown below:

- `etcdctl set key1 value1`
- `etcdctl get key1`

Between v2 and v3 of `etcd` there was a lot of changes (mostly generated by the implementation of the RAFT protocol).

To know which version is compatible with your `etcctl` just run `etcctl --version` and check the "API version".

Since `etcdctl` version 3.4, the default API version is v3.

You can configure the proper API version by either setting an environment variable `ETCDCTL_API=3`.

With the v3 API, the `--version` is no longer an argument but a command `etcdctl version`.

For API v3, the commands also change a bit:

- `etcdctl put key1 value1`
- `etcdctl get key1`

### ETCD Role in Kubernetes

All metadata related to the cluster (Nodes, Pods, Roles, etc.) is stored in ETCD.

There are two ways of installing `etcd`. Manually (mentioned earlier) or through `kubeadm`.

If you install it with `kubeadm`, it will run as a pod inside the `kube-system` namespace.

You can view data directly by interacting with the pod `kubectl exec etcd-master -n kube-system etcdctl get / --prefix -keys-only`.

Inside there is a directory structure. The root directory is named `registry`. Under the root directory you have varous kubernetes constructs that contain data.

In a HA environment, you would have a multi-master setup with `etcd` running on each of the master nodes. Make sure that `etcd` instances know about each other by configuring the proper parameters.

### Kube API Server

When you run `kubectl` command, it connects to the `kube-apiserver`, which authenticates the command and retrieves data from `etcd`, then it returns the data to `kubectl`.

It is not mandatory to use `kubectl`. You can call the API directly. Although `kubectl` is the most popular chioce.

When running a command (e.g. create a new pood), you send the command to the `kube-apiserver`, which then updates the data in `etcd` cluster. The `kube-scheduler` monitors the `kube-apiserver` and detects that there are changes inside the cluster (a new unassigned pod). It then identifies the node on which the pod should be placed in, it indicates that to the `kube-apiserver`. The `kube-apiserver` updates the `etcd` data and then sends the commands to `kubelet` on the specific node. The `kubelet` then creates the pod on the node and instructs the container runtime to deploy the application image. Once this is done the `kubelet` updates the status to the `kube-apiserver` and then the `kube-apiserver` updates the data inside the `etcd` cluster.

This workflow is performed on every change. The `kube-apiserver` is responsible with the following tasks:

- Authenticate User
- Validate Request
- Retrieve data
- Update ETCD
- Scheduler
- Kubelet

**The `kube-apiserver` is the only component that directly interacts with the `etcd` cluster. The rest of the components (scheduler, controller manager, etc) will directly interact with `kube-apiserver`.**

### Kube Controller Manager

In Kubernetes ecosystem, a controller is the process that continuously monitors the state of various components on the system and works towards bringing the system to the desired functioning state.

As an example, the node controller monitors the state of the worker nodes through the `kube-apiserver` every 5 seconds. If a node becomes unreachable, it will wait 40 seconds until it will actually mark it as unreachable. It will wait another 5 minutes until it will remove the pods assigned to that node and will provision them on other healthy nodes.

All controllers are packaged under a single process named **Kube-Controller-Manager**.

### Kube Scheduler

The Kube Scheduler **is responsible only for deciding where** to put a pod. It doesn't directly deploy it on the node.

The scheduler goes through 2 phases to identify the proper node for the pod:

- The scheduler filters out the nodes that do not fit the profile for the pod (e.g. the pod might require 10 CPU cores)
- From the remaining nodes, the scheduler ranks the nodes based on the resources available on them. It calculates the resources that would be free after placing the specific pods on them. The scale is from 0 to 10.

These settings can be customised, although the default ones are pretty sane.

There are plenty of conditions that the scheduler uses to place the pod on the proper node:

- Resource Requirements and Limits
- Taints and Tolerations
- Node Selectors/Affinity
- etc.

### Kubelet

The `kubelet` registers the node with the Kubernetes cluster. When it receives a command to start a container, it then instructs the container runtime (e.g. docker) to pull the image and run an instance.

The `kubelet` then monitors the state of the Node and the Pod and reports it to the `kube-apiserver` on a timely basis.

**`kubeadm` does not deploy kubelet on the worker nodes. You must install it manually on each node.**

### Kube Proxy

In Kubernetes, every pod can reacy every other pod. This is achieved by deploying a pod networking solution in the cluster.

A pod network is an internal virtual network that spans across all nodes and all pods connect to it.

Since IPs are dynamic, pods are connecting to eachother using services. Each service receives its own IP address. The service doesn't join the pod network since it is not a pod nor does it have a listening process. It is a virtual components that runs in Kubernetes memory.

Since the service must be accessed at the cluster level, the `kube-proxy` allows that.

`kube-proxy` it's a process that runs on each node and its job is to look for new services and, when it finds a new one, it creates the proper rules so that traffic is forwarded to the service and to the backend pods. It usually does that with `iptables` rules.

### Kubernetes Pods

Kubernetes doesn't directly deploy containers on the nodes. The container is encapsulated in a Kubernetes object named **Pod**.

**A pod is a single instance of an application. A pod is the smallest object that you can create in Kubernetes.**

Usually, there is a single container running in one pod. But there are some exceptions where we can run multiple containers in a single pod.

When this happens, the containers that run inside the pod are not the same. Usually it is the main application container and a helper container or a sidecar container. These containers provide some support functionality to the main container.

Since they share the same network space, containers inside a pod can communicate with eachother using `localhost`.

### Pods with YAML

Instead of directly running `kubectl` commands to interact with Kubernetes components (pods, deployments, etc.), we can use YAML configuration files to define our resources. These files are known as *definition files* or *manifest files*.

They contain 4 root level fields (all of them are required):

- apiVersion
- kind
- metadata
- spec

#### apiVersion

This is the version of the Kubernetes API for the type of resource that we intend to create. Since we are trying to create a pod, it takes the value of `v1`.

Popular values are found in the following table:

|Kind|Version|
|---|---|
|Pod|`v1`|
|Service|`v1`|
|ReplicaSet|`apps/v1`|
|Deployment|`apps/v1`|

#### Kind

This is the type of object we want to create. In this case, `Pod`.

More kind types can be found in the previous table.

#### Metadata

Metadata is data about the object in form of a dictionary. It can contain items like name, labels, etc.

Only some specific parameters can be palced inside the metadata:

- namespace
- name
- uid
- resourceVersion
- generation
- creationTimestamp
- deletionTimestamp
- labels
- annotations

More details can be found on [community GitHub page](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata)

#### Spec

This is where we provide the data for the pod object.

Spec is a dictionary. For a pod, it takes the value of `containers`. Containers is a list object in which we define each container inside the pod.

#### Sample pod file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-server
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
```

To create the resource run `kubectl apply -f pod-definition.yml`. You can also use `kubectl create` command when the resource is new. But most of the time `apply` will do it.

### Replication Controller and Replica Set

The replication controller makes sure that the desired number of instances for the specific resource type is present on the system at all times.

This helps with the scalability and fault tolerance of Kubernetes applications.

It is important that there are two similar terms: Replication Controller and Replica Set. Both have the same purpose but are not the same.

The replication controller is the old version of replica set.

The definition for Replication Controller looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: nginx-rc
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-server
      labels:
        app: nginx-server
        type: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx:latest
  replicas: 3
```

For replication controller, inside the `spec` section, we need to specify a template for the pod which the replication controller targets. This is usually done by actually configuring the pod inside the template. So the `template` section must contain the `metadata` and the `spec` sections of the pod.

Now in order to mention the number of desired replicas, we need to add the `replicas` key at the same level with `template`.

To view the replication controller status run `kubectl get replicationcontroller`.

For the **Replica Set** the configuration is similar.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-replicaset
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-server
      labels:
        app: nginx-server
        type: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx:latest
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: front-end
```

The main diference between Replication Controller and Replica Set, when it comes to the YAML file, is that the `apiVersion` and `kind` are different.

There is also a new key named `selector` which helps to better identify the pod to create replicas for. This was created to allow the management of pods that were not created by the current replica set definition file. The selector is a requred field and, if it doesn't manage external pods, it must match the labels for the pod in the current definition file.

The `selector` is also available in Replication Controller but it is not mandatory and if ommited (as we did) it autopopulates with the labels of the pod in the definition.

Labeling is used mainly as a filter for the Replica Set. Since Replica Set monitors the pods, we need to specify which pods to monitor through these labels. We do that because we might not need to scale all of our pods.

Same concept of Labels and Selectors are being used in many areas of Kubernetes.

One might ask *"Why do we need the `template` section in a replica set if I want to monitor only previously created pods?"*. Well, if one of your already running pods will crash, **the Replica Set must know the details of the pod it must recreate in order to fulfill the deisred number of pods**.

To update the replica set, run `kubectl replace -f replicaset-definition.yml` although the `kubectl apply` command also works here.

### Deployments

So far we talked about how containers that are encapsulated in a pod and the number of pods is managed via a Replica Set.

A deployment manages Replica Sets. It handles how the new version of applications are deployed and what to do when there is an error during the deployment of the new version.

The deployment definition file is similar to the Replica Set definition file, with the exception that the `kind` is now `Deployment`.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-replicaset
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-server
      labels:
        app: nginx-server
        type: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx:latest
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: front-end
```

When you will run `kubectl get pods` you will notice that there are some ids that are trainling the pod name.

```text
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-replicaset-65485cd66c-54bpd   1/1     Running   0          6s
nginx-replicaset-65485cd66c-ck9db   1/1     Running   0          6s
nginx-replicaset-65485cd66c-nfxcd   1/1     Running   0          6s
```

We have `application name`-replicaset-`deployment id`-`replica id`.

If you run `kubectl det all`, you will notice that the deployment id will match.

So the deployment creates a replica set, which creates a number of pods, in which runs a container.

### Services

Kubernetes services enable communication between various components inside and outside of an application.

Services will facilitate the communication between the user and the frontend, the frontend and the backend, the backend and the database.

The service maps the access from the user to the node then from the node to the pod which gets to the container.

There are multiple service types:

- NodePort Service: will map the specified port directly on the node. You will access the application by accessing the IP of the node and the port mentioned in the configuration of the service.
- ClusterIP: will allow the communication between various components inside the Kubernetes cluster (front end with back end, etc.). This allows the front ent to connect to the back end by using the name of the service.
- LoadBalancer: It provisions a load balancer for the application in supported cloud providers.

#### NodePort

This type of service will map a specific port from the node (e.g. 30080) to the port of the application that listens inside the pod (e.g. 80). This way we can access the application that listens on port 80 by accessing the node on port 30080.

There 3 types of ports in this service type:

- NodePort: The port on the node (from 30000 to 332767)
- Port: The port of the service (remember, the service gets its own IP)
- TargetPort: The port of the Pod

Inside the cluster, applications can use the port of the service to access the application of the desired pod. Meanwhile the user must use the NodePort.

The service definition file looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - targetPort: 80 # Optional, will match port if omitted
      port: 80
      nodePort: 30080 # Optional, will be assigned automatically if omitted
  selector:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
```

For the `selector`, use the labels of the pod directly.

When there are multiple pods on a node (as with a deployment or replica set), the service automatically decides on which pod to send the connection to. It has two parameters:

- Algorithm: `Random`
- SessionAffinity: `Yes`

#### ClusterIP

With the ClusterIP service type, the communication inside the cluster is made through the name of the service. This happends because the IPs of the pods are dynamic and change over time. It also benefits from the load balancing capability of services.

In the case of ClusterIP, there are only two types of ports:

- Port: The port of the service (remember, the service gets its own IP)
- TargetPort: The port of the Pod

The ClusterIP definition file looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: back-end
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - targetPort: 80 # Optional, will match port if omitted
      port: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
```

#### LoadBalancer

On on-premise setups, the Load Balancer is an external VM or device that handles the connection between the user and the nodes so the LoadBalancer service type is rarely used (there are some on premise load balancers that can be configured with the LoadBalancer service but rarely used)

The LoadBalancer service type is used mostly in cloud environments (e.h. AWS) to configure the external Load Balancer that will handle traffic between the users and the nodes. **Only some cloud providers will work with this type of service!**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer # If used on unsupported environments, it will act as NodePort
  ports:
    - targetPort: 80 # Optional, will match port if omitted
      port: 80
      nodePort: 30080 # Optional, will be assigned automatically if omitted
```

### Namespaces

Namespaces can be seen as houses in which families interact with eachother. Each person uses the First Name to interact to the other. Someone from outside the house will use also the Last Name to talk to someone from a specific house, since there might be two people with the same First Name.

By using that analogy, we can define namespaces as a logical separator of resources inside a Kubernetes cluster.

There are some namespaces that created automatically when installing Kubernetes:

- kube-system: System components of the Kubernetes Cluster
- default
- kube-public: Resources that should be available for all users

In production, the default namespace is rarely used since usually we need namespace isolation (e.g. dev, staging and prod).

We can also allocate quota of resources for each namespace.

Each service receives a local DNS entry inside the cluster in the form of `{service-name}.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local`. So we have two scenarios:

- app from namepsace1 wants to talk to db on namespace1, it will access `db-service` directly
- app from namespace1 wants to talk to db on namespace2, it will access `db-service.namespace2.svc.cluste.local`

When running `kubectl` command, by default, the namespace that will be used is `default`. To specify the namespace use `--namespace` or `-n` followed by the name of the namespace.

When using a definition file, you can use the `namespace` key inside the root `metadata`.

A namespace definition file looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dev
```

You can also configure the kubectl command to use another namespace by default by running `kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=dev`.

To limit resources in a namespace, we need to create a ResourceQuota definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: compute-quota
  namespace: dev
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "10"
    requests.cpu: "4"
    requests.memory: 5Gi
    limits.cpu: "10"
    limits.memory: 10Gi
```

### Imperative vs. Declarative

In Kubernetes, objects can be created imperative way by running kubectl commands directly or by creating a definition file and updating it using kubectl command arguments such as `create`, `edit`,, `replace`, `scale`, etc. followed by the `-f {filename}` argument.

The declarative way is considered to be the use of `apply` argument of `kubectl` command on the same files.

## Scheduling

Every pod has a field called NodeName that, by default, is not set. You don't typically specify this field when you create the pod manifest file. Kubernetes adds it automatically. The scheduler goes through all the pods and looks for those that do not have this property set. Those are the candidates for scheduling. It then identifies the right node for the pod by running the scheduling algorithm. Once identified, it schedules the pod on the node by setting the node name property to the name of the node by creating a binding object.

If there is no scheduler, the pod will remain in Penging status, unless we manually schedule it.

### Manual Scheduling

The easiest way to manually schedule a pod, is to manually configure the nodeName item to the name of the desired node from your cluster.

If the pod is already created and you want to assign the pod to a node, Kubernetes won't allow you to modify the node name property of a pod, so another way to assign a node to an existing pod is to create a binding object and send a POST request to the pod's binding API, thus mimicking what the actual scheduler does.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Binding
metadata:
  name: nginx
target:
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Node
  name: node02
```

Next, you need to convert the YAML file to JSON and send it with a POST request to the kube-apiserver.

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type:application/json" --request POST --data '{json data}' https://{{ server }}/api/v1/namespaces/{{ namespace }}/pods/{{ pod name }}/binding.
```

**While this involves multiple steps, you can always delete the pod, change the configuration file and apply the new settings.** This way you do not need to perform the conversion and remember the API endpoint.

### Labels and Selectors

As discussed before, labels and selectors are used for filtering object in Kubernetes to achieve various tasks.

Previously, we used the `selector` keyword to identify which pod is affected by the replica set. But we can use the labels and selector for various cases. An example is with kubectl, to view pods that have a specific label: `kubectl get pods --selector app=App1`. To use multiple selectors, separate the kv pairs by comma.

While labels and selectors are used to group and select objects, **annotations** are used to record other details for informatory purpose.

For example, tool details like name, version, build information, etc., or contact details, phone numbers, email IDs, etc., that may be used for some kind of integration purpose.

### Taints and Tolerations

To better grasp the concepts of taints and tolerations, we will use an analogy of a bug trying to land on a human.

A **taint** is the bug repellant spray that we apply on the skin to prevent the bug landing on the human.

There might be some bugs that are **tolerant** to the spray and gets to land on the person.

In the case of Kubernetes, the nodes are the humans and the pods are the bugs.

If we set a taint on a specific node and since the pods, by default, have no tolerations, no pods will be scheduled on that node.

To allow a pod to be scheduled on that specific node, we must add a tolleration to the pod that matches the taint of the node.

**This doesn't mean that the pod will be scheduled only on that node. If no other taints are specified on other nodes, the scheduler automatically decide where that pod will be placed. The purpose of taints and tolerations ensures that no other type of pods can be scheduled on the node.**

To set a taint: `kubectl taint nodes {{ node-name }} myTaint=Red:{{ taint-effect }}`

To unset a taint run the ommand again but add a `-` at the end. No spaces, stick the `-` to the command.

The taint-effect decides what happends to the pods that do not tolerate the taint and can have 3 values:

- NoSchedule: Do not schedule new pods on this node
- PreferNoSchedule: Try not to schedule on this node, but that is not guaranteed
- NoExecute: New pods will not be scheduled on the node and existing pods present on the node will be evicted

To configure a toleration, change the pod definition file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-server
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
  tolerations: # Doublequotes for values are mandatory for this one
    - key: "app"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "red"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
```

By default master nodes have a taint that prevents any pods to be scheduled on it. Even though we can remove that taint, it is a best practice to not deploy workloads on the master node.

To see the master node taint run: `kubectl describe node kubemaster | grep Taint`.

### Node Selectors

To force Kubernetes to assign a pod to a specific node, we can also use nodeSelector property.

Assuming we have a cluster with 3 nodes of various specifications (CPU, Memory, Storage, etc.).

Each node has a label named `size` which indicates the size of their specs.

We can then use the following pod definition file to tell Kubernetes that we want our pod to run on nodes that are "Larege" in size.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-server
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
  nodeSelector:
    size: Large
```

The label on the node must be created before the pod. To add a label run: `kubectl label nodes {{ node name }} size:Large`.

NodeSelector has its limitations, since we cannot use advanced selectors such as `or` or `not`.

### Node Affinity

To overcome the limitations of NodeSelector, NodeAffinity was implemented.

Node affinity configuration has great complexity. An example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-server
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: size
            operator: In # equivalent of or. So add a new item to the values if you need the Large or Small or Medium.
            values:
              - Large
```

For a deployment, it will look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-replicaset
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-server
      labels:
        app: nginx-server
        type: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx:latest
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
              - matchExpressions:
                - key: size
                  operator: In # equivalent of or. So add a new item to the values if you need the Large or Small or Medium.
                  values:
                    - Large
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: front-end
```

For more operators, [check the documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#operators).

Node affinity types are the following:

- `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` - Mandatory to schedule on the specific node. If the node changes labels while the pod is running, nothing will happen.
- `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` - Make the best effort to schedule on the specific node but it will not force it.

More types are planned for future development.

|Type|DuringScheduling|DuringExecution|
|---|---|---|
|Type 1|Required|Ignored|
|Type 2|Preferred|Ignored|

**To completely dedicate nodes to specific pods, we use a combination of taints/tolerations and node affinity.**

We use taints and tolerations to prevent nodes from accepting different types of pods. And we set the node affinity to tell the pods to go only on specific nodes.

### Resource Requirements and Limits

Since the kube-scheduler will check for resources before allocating a pod to a node, we can optimise this process by mentioning resource requirements and limits for the containers inside the pod.

Resource requests are like minimum treshold for the container (reserved resources), and limits are the top limits.

A sample pod definition with resource requests looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-server
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "4Gi"
          cpu: 2 # It represents number of cores or hyperthreads
```

CPU can take values as low as 0.1 (or 1m). 1 count of CPU is 1 vCPU, Core, or Hyperthread.

For memory we can use various units such as: bytes, Gigabytes, Gibibytes, etc.

By default, containers have no limits, so we can set them like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-server
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "4Gi"
          cpu: 2 # It represents number of cores or hyperthreads
        limits:
          memory: "8Gi"
          cpu: 4
```

If a pod exceeds its CPU resources, the CPU will be throttled. This does not happen with the memory. If the pod constantly uses more memory than its limit, the pod will be terminated and inside the events of the pod you will see a message containing "OOM Killed" which means Out Of Memory.

Most of the time you will use requests without limits. If you use no requests and no limits, you might get improper use of CPU by some pods, thus, limiting the performance of other pods on the node.

#### Limit Range

You can set limits at the namespace level for pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: cpu-resource-constraint
spec:
  limits:
    - default: # Limit
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 1Gi
      defaultRequest: # Request
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 1Gi
      max: # Limit
        cpu: "1"
        memory: 1Gi
      min: # Request
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 500Mi
      type: Container
```

These settings are applied when the pod is created. If you change these settings after that, they will not be applied to existing pods.

#### Resource Quotas

There is a way to restrict the total amount of resources that can be consumed by applications deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.

For example, all the pods together shouldn't consume more than a specific amount of CPU or memory, what we could do is create quotas at the namespace level.

So a resource quota is a namespace level object that can be created to set hard limits for requests and limits.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: my-resource-quota
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: 4
    requests.memory: 4Gi
    limits.cpu: 10
    limits.memory: 10Gi
```

### Daemon Sets

Daemon Sets are similar to Replica Sets with the difference that Daemon Sets runs one copy of your pod on each node in the cluster. When a new node is added to the cluster, automatically, a new replica of the pod is added to that node.

Daemon Sets are mainly used for monitoring agents or log collectors.

One example of a Daemon Set is `kube-proxy`. Another example is the networking agent (e.g. calico or weave-net).

The daemon set definition file is quite similar to the replica set one:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: monitoring-daemon
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: monitoring-agent
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: monitoring-agent
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: monitoring-agent
          image: monitoring-agent
```

To view the daemon sets run `kubectl get daemonsets` and for more details use the `describe` option of kubectl.

Until Kubernetes version v1.12, the daemon sets used the `nodeName` option to distribute the pods across all nodes. After v1.12, the Daemon Sets uses the `NodeAffinity` and the default scheduler.

### Static Pods

The `kubelet` can manage a node independently, without being into a cluster.

In the absence of a `kube-apiserver`, which provides the pod creation data, we can store pod definition files in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`. Kubelet will read files from that directory periodically and applies what it finds.

Pods created this way are called static pods.

You can also configure another directory for that purpose. You must then change the argument `--pod-manifest-path` of the kubelet service running on the host to read files from that directory or you can pass a configuration file with `--config` argument to specify an external configuration file that contains various settings, including `staticPodPath`.

To view the static pods, we use the `docker ps` command. **We use the docker command directly because we do not have the `kube-apiserver` so `kubectl` cannot interact with pods.**

As an alternative, if docker is not the container runtime that is being used on the node, we can use `crictl ps` or `nerdctl ps` depending on which container runtime we use.

If the node is part of the cluster, we can have both types of pods. Regular pods and static pods. This is possible because the kubelet has two type of inputs:

- From a directory
- From an HTTP endpoint (receives commands from kube-apiserver)

Static pods are made available on the cluster level because once the kubelet creates the static pod, it informs the kube-apiserver that a new pod was created on the node and then the kube-apiserver stores the data in etcd.

**We cannot manipulate the static pod though the kube-apiserver, what we see from there is a read-only mirror of the object created on the node.**

The name of the static pod is automatically appended with the node name.

A popular use case for static pods, since they are independent from the kube-apiserver, is to **deploy the control plane as pods** on the nodes. **This is how `kubeadm` sets up a cluster.**

### Priority Classes

In Kubernetes we can set the priority of resources on the cluster. The standard range (for databases, critical apps, josb, etc.) is from -2.147.483.648 to 1.000.000.000. There is another special range that is from 1.000.000.000 and goes up to 2.000.000.000. This special range is for Kubernetes system components.

To list current priorty classes run: `kubectl get priorityclass`.

To create a new priority class we need to create a definition file:

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: high-priority
value: 1000000000
description: "Priority class for mission critical pods"
globalDefault: true # Optional, this changes the default pods priority to the value we set (standard is 0)
```

After we create the priority class, we then associate it with a pod inside the pod definition file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-server
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
  priorityClassName: high-priority
```

If we do not assign a priority class to a pod, the default value is 0.

The priority class establishes the priority of workloads that are placed on the cluster. Higher priority workloads will be placed before the lower priority ones.

If the cluster is almost at capacity, and a higher priority workloads appears, by default, the cluster will evict lower priority workloads (`PreemptLowerPriority`).

This behaviour can be changed by setting the `preemptionPolicy` in the priority class definition file at the root level.

### Multiple Schedulers

Since Kubernetes is extensible, you can write your own scheduler, package it and deploy it on the cluster. You can even set it as the default scheduler.

You can run multiple schedulers in a single cluster. You just need to instruct Kubernetes to schedule a specific pod with a specific scheduler.

To configure a new scheduler, you can use a sample definition file like the one below:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
  - schedulerName: my-scheduler
```

You can deploy a new scheduler two ways. Either by importing the binary of your own custom scheduler, or by using the same binary of the standard kube-scheduler and configure a new service for it. Inside the service, you set the `--config` option to point to the new kube-scheduler definition file.

99% of the time, you will deploy the kube-scheduler as a static pod (like kubeadm does it). In this case, the pod definition file looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-scheduler
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  containers:
    - command:
        - kube-scheduler
        - --address=127.0.0.1
        - --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
        - --config=/etc/kubernetes/my-scheduler-config.yaml
      image: k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler/amd64:v1.11.3
      name: kube-scheduler
```

When running multiple copies of a scheduler on a cluster, only one can be active at a time, so for this we configure a leader election option inside the scheduler configuration file at the root level:

```yaml
...
leaderElection:
  leaderElect: true
  resourceNamespace: kube-system
  resourceName: lock-object-my-scheduler
...
```

### Scheduler Profiles

The scheduler works in the following phases:

- Pods are placed in a queue and sorted by priority
- The filtering stage happends where the requirements are being evaluated to pick the proper node
- The scoring phase happends to better identify what node to use from the remaining filtered nodes
- The pod is binded to a node and then deployed on it

These phases are being performed through some scheduling plugins:

- The queueing phase is done by `PrioritySort` plugin
- The filtering is performed by `NodeResourceFit` plugin. Also there are other plugins available on this stage if they are needed such as: `NodeName`, `NodeUnschedulable`, etc.
- The scoring phase is also done by `NodeResourcesFit`. Another example is the `ImageLocality` plugin.
- In the binding phase we have the `DefaultBinder` plugin.

At each stage there is an extension point to which a plugin can be attached to. We can use these extension points to change how the scheduler works by picking what filter are being used in which phase.

To view schedulers available on the system, you just display the pods on the `kube-system` namespace and check which ones are the schedulers.

To configure a pod to use the custom scheduler we use `schedulerName` inside the `spec` of that pod and set it to the name of the scheduler.

If the scheduler was not configured correctly, the pod will remain in Pending state.

We can see which scheduler handled which pod by using the `kubectl get events -o wide` command. We can also view the logs of the scheduler with the command `kubectl logs my-scheduler -n kube-system`.

With the `profiles` option of the `KubeScheduletConfiguration` kind we can set multiple schedulers under the same binary, thus the name scheduler profiles.

Each profile can enable or disable plugins for a specific phase:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
  - schedulerName: my-scheduler
    plugins:
      score:
        disabled:
          - name: TaintToleration
        enabled:
          - name: MyCustomPluginA
          - name: MyCustomPluginB
  - schedulerName: my-scheduler-2
```

### Admission Controllers

When running a `kubectl` command, it gets authenticated and then authorised through an RBAC mechanism inside Kubernetes.

The standard RBAC controls of Kubernetes are related to Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.

A sample of a role can be found here:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: developer
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs:  ["create"]
    resourceNames: ["blue", "orange"]
```

This limits the developer user to create pods with names blue or orange.

Verbs can be: list, get, create, update, or delete.

If we want more advanced controls (e.g. use only a specific private repository for pulling image, or never use the latest tag on images, etc.), we can use admission controllers.

There are multiple admission controllers:

- AlwaysPullImages
- DefaultStorageClass
- EventRateLimit
- NamespaceExists,
- etc.

Some of the admission controllers are enabled by default (e.g. NamespaceExists), while others (e.g. NamespaceAutoProvision) are not.

To see the list of default admission controllers run `kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins`.

If you deployed the cluster with kubeadm, the kube-apiserver command resides inside the pod so we must run it like this: `kubectl exec kube-apiserver-controlplane -n kube-system -- kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins`

To add a new admission controller, edit the kube-apiserver configuration to enable that specific controller. To disable, we do the same. Just check the help menu of kube-apiserver command to identify the proper option.

**Note that the NamespaceAutoProvision and NamespaceExists are deprecated and were replaced by NamespaceLifecycle admission controller.**

So those are two types of admission controllers. **Mutating admission controllers** are those that can change the request and **validating admission controllers** are those that can validate the request, and allow or deny it, and there may be **admission controllers that can do both**.

Usually the mutating admission controllers are called before the validating admission controllers so that any change applied by the first one is validated by the second ones.

We can add our own admission controllers through two special admission controllers that act as a web hook:

- MutatingAdmissionWebhook
- ValidatingAdmissionWebhook

We can point these webhooks to webservers inside the cluster or outside it. The webserver will have its own webhook service and its own logic.

The webhook can be configured like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: "pod-policy.example.com"
webhooks:
  - name: "pod-policy.example.com"
    clientConfig:
      url: "https://external-server.example.com" # Only for external servers
      service: # Only for local servers
        namespace: "webhook-namespace"
        name: "webhook-service"
      caBundle: "lkjsfdskljhrls...fejfhsld" # Only if necessary
    rules:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        apiVersions: ["v1"]
        operations: ["CREATE"]
        resources: ["pods"]
        scope: "Namespaced"
```

## Logging and Monitoring

### Monitoring Cluster Components

Kubernetes does not come with built-in monitoring solutions. We can use tools such as: metricsserver, prometheus, ELK, DataDog, Dynatrace, etc.

We can have one Metrics Server per Kubernetes cluster, it retrieves metrics from nodes and pods, aggregates them and then stores them in memory. **It doesn't store metrics on the disk, only in memory.**

The Metrics Server collects data about pods from the Kubelet through a Kubelet component named cAdvisor.

To view the resources run either `kubectl top node` or `kubectl top pod`.

**WARNING! Even though the course presents the Metrics Server as the go to solution for monitoring the Kubernetes Cluster, [the GitHub webpage of Kubernetes Metrics Server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) states that:**

**"Metrics Server is meant only for autoscaling purposes. For example, don't use it to forward metrics to monitoring solutions, or as a source of monitoring solution metrics. In such cases please collect metrics from Kubelet `/metrics/resource` endpoint directly."**

### Managing Application Logs

As with docker containers, we can check the logs of a pod by running `kubectl logs [-f] my-pod`. If there are multiple containers in a pod, we need to specify the container `kubectl logs -f my-pod my-container-1`.

## Application Lifecycle Management

### Updates and Rollbacks

To view the rollout status of a deployment run `kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment`.

To check the rollout history: `kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp-deployment.

There are two types of deployment strategies:

- Recreate: Destroy older instances then creates new ones. This results in a downtime between the destruction of the old instance and the start of the new instance
- RollingUpdate (default): Destroy old version and create new version one by one

What happends under the hood of an upgrade:

- When starting a fresh application, the deployment will automatically create a replica set which creates a number of pods
- When we update the pod specs (e.g. the image version), a new replica set is created alongside the old one
- Then the new replica set is set to increase the number of pod replicas 1 by 1 while the old replica set is set to decrease that number 1 by 1 once the new replica set pod is running.

We can set the strategy by changing `.spec.strategy.type` of a deployment.

The rolling update of a deployment can also get some values such as `maxUnavailable` or other options.

### Application Configuration

#### Command Configuration

Let's assume that we have a docker image with ubuntu that has the entrypoint `sleep` and the command `5`.

When we want to deploy the pod with a different time of sleep, we add `.spec.containers[0].args` and set the value to `["10"]`. Not that the `args` is a list.

When we want to change the entrypoint, we set the `.spec.containers[0].command` to `["sleep2.0"]`.

Even though the course tells us that the command refers to the entrypoint, we saw in [Multiple Schedulers](#multiple-schedulers) chapter that the command had the entrypoint and the arguments under the same section `command`.

Ideally the command holds only the entrypoint, and the args has the arguments. Just like with `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` in a Dockerfile.

#### Environment Variables

The basic way to set an environment variable for a Pod, we use the `env` property at the level of the container, similar to docker-compose files. The difference is the format of the declaration:

```yaml
...
env:
  - name: my_var
    value: 1
...
```

There are other ways to set environment variables to a pod by using ConfigMaps and/or Secrets.

```yaml
...
env:
  - name: APP_COLOR
    valueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: my-config-map
        key: APP_COLOR
  - name: my_secret
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: app-secret
        key: DB_PASSWORD
...
```

#### ConfigMaps

ConfigMaps are a way to centrally configure various configurations (e.g. environment variables) for a pod without complicating the pod definition file.

There are two phases:

- Create the ConfigMap
- Inhject the ConfigMap into the pod

To create a ConfigMap we can either use the imperative way:

 ```bash
 # Key value pairs
 kubectl create configmap \
    app-config --from-literal=APP_COLOR=blue

 # KV pairs from a file
 kubectl create configmap \
    app-config --from-file=app_config.properties
 ```

or through a definition file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  APP_COLOR: blue
  APP_MODE: prod
```

To list config maps run `kubectl get configmaps`. The `describe` command will list the contents of the configmap.

Once we created our configmap we can inject it into the pod this way:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-server
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
      env:
        - name: APP_COLOR # Specific variable from the config map
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: my-config-map
              key: APP_COLOR
      envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: app-config # The whole config map
      volumes:
        - name: app-config-volume
          configMap: # We can use the configmap as a file inside the container
            name: app-config
```

#### Secrets

Secrets are used to store sensitive informations. They are similar to Config Maps but they store the data into an encoded format.

We have the same phases: create and inject.

To create a secret in an imperative way, run:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic \
    {{ secret_name }} --from-literal=DB_PASSWORD=mypassword

kubectl create secret generic \
    {{ secret_name }} --from-file={{ secrets_filepath }}
```

With a definition file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: app-secret
data: # values must be in base64
  DB_PASSWORD: Ymx1ZQ==
  DB_USER: cHJvZA==
```

To list secrets we proceed similarly to configMaps.

To view a secret, we need to use the `-o yaml` when we run `describe secret` using the `kubectl` command.

To view the decoded values we usually decode the base64 string once we display it with describe. Another, more direct way is to run `kubectl get secrets/app-secret --template={{.data.DB_PASSWORD}} | base64 -d`

To inject a secret into a pod we proceed similarly to ConfigMaps:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-server
  labels:
    app: nginx-server
    type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
      envFrom:
        - secretRef: # All secrets
            name: app-secret
      env:
        - name: DB_PASSWORD
          valuesFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: app-secret
              key: DB_PASSWORD
      volumes:
        - name: app-secret-volume
          secret:
            secretName: app-secret
```

When we mount the secrets as files, we can see them inside the container in `/opt/app-secret/{{ key }}`

**Secrets are not encrypted, they are only encoded.** We can [enable encryption at rest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/) by using `EncryptionConfiguration`.

It is a common practice to use an external secret manager such as AWS KMS, Hashicorp Vault, etc.

### Multi-Container Pods

In Kubernetes, a **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit, often comprising multiple containers that share the same network namespace and storage volumes. Within this context, two common patterns emerge: **Sidecar containers** and **Co-located containers**. While both reside within the same Pod, they serve distinct roles and have different lifecycle behaviors.

A **Sidecar container** is a secondary container that runs alongside the main application container within the same Pod. Its primary purpose is to enhance or extend the functionality of the main application without modifying its code. Common use cases include logging, monitoring, proxying, and data synchronization.

Starting with Kubernetes v1.29, sidecar containers are implemented as **restartable init containers** by setting `restartPolicy: Always`, and are placed under the `initContainers` field. This approach ensures that sidecar containers start before and are terminated after the main application containers and continue running throughout the Pod's lifecycle.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-with-logging-sidecar
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: shared-logs
      emptyDir: {}
  initContainers:
    - name: log-shipper
      image: alpine:latest
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'tail -F /opt/logs.txt']
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /opt
      restartPolicy: Always
  containers:
    - name: main-app
      image: alpine:latest
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do echo "logging" >> /opt/logs.txt; sleep 1; done']
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /opt
```

**Co-located containers** refer to multiple containers running within the same Pod that collaborate to achieve a common goal. That is the new term now used to distinguish what was previously referred to as a sidecar before the Kubernetes v1.29 updates. Unlike sidecar containers, co-located containers often share equal responsibility in the application's functionality. They can start and stop independently and may not have a defined startup order.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-server-with-helper
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: shared-content
      emptyDir: {}
  containers:
    - name: content-generator
      image: busybox
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo " Hello from Helper! " > /output/index.html && sleep 3600']
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-content
          mountPath: /output
    - name: web-server
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-content
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
```

### Init-Containers

In a multi-container pod, each container is expected to run a process that stays alive as long as the POD's lifecycle. For example in the multi-container pod that we talked about earlier that has a web application and logging agent, both the containers are expected to stay alive at all times. The process running in the log agent container is expected to stay alive as long as the web application is running. If any of them fails, the POD restarts.

But at times you may want to run a process that runs to completion in a container. For example a process that pulls a code or binary from a repository that will be used by the main web application. That is a task that will be run only one time when the pod is first created. Or a process that waits for an external service or database to be up before the actual application starts. That's where **initContainers** comes in.

An **initContainer** is configured in a pod like all other containers, except that it is specified inside a `initContainers` section, like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'git clone <some-repository-that-will-be-used-by-application> ; done;']
```

When a POD is first created the initContainer is run, and the process in the initContainer must run to a completion before the real container hosting the application starts.

You can configure multiple such initContainers as well, like how we did for multi-containers pod. In that case each init container is run **one at a time in sequential order**.

If any of the initContainers fail to complete, Kubernetes restarts the Pod repeatedly until the Init Container succeeds.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup myservice; do echo waiting for myservice; sleep 2; done;']
  - name: init-mydb
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup mydb; do echo waiting for mydb; sleep 2; done;']
```

### Self Healing Applications

Kubernetes supports self-healing applications through ReplicaSets and Replication Controllers. The replication controller helps in ensuring that a POD is re-created automatically when the application within the POD crashes. It helps in ensuring enough replicas of the application are running at all times.

Kubernetes provides additional support to check the health of applications running within PODs and take necessary actions through Liveness and Readiness Probes. However these are not required for the CKA exam and as such they are not covered here. These are topics for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developers (CKAD) exam and are covered in the CKAD course.

### Autoscaling

Generally there are two types of scaling: vertical (more resources on the same node), and horizontal (more nodes).

In Kubernetes we can scale two items:

- Workloads
  - Vertical: Increase the resource limits of the pods
  - Horizontal: Add/remove pods replicas
- Cluster Infrastructure
  - Vertical: Increase the resources of the node
  - Horizontal: Add/remove nodes

Scaling can be performed manually or in an automated fashion.

We won't touch the manual scaling since it represents basic tasks such as adding new nodes or scaling pods which were previously covered.

For the Cluster Infrastructure automated scaling we have something called Cluster Autoscaler. It handles only horizontal scaling.

For the workloads we have Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA).

#### HPA

The HPA monitors the metrics of the cluster and it changes the value of replicas in deployments based on those metrics. It can scale up or down the number of pods in the cluster.

To create an HPA in an imperative mode we need to tarket the deployment and set conditions: `kubectl autoscale deployment my-app --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10`.

To delete it run `kubectl delete hpa my-app`

To use the declarative method:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 1
  maxreplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
          target:
            type: Utilization
            averageUtilization: 50
```

*HPA is available from Kubernetes v1.23 and `metrics-server` is a prerequisite.*

We can connect HPA to other data through External Adapters or Custom Metrics Adapter (internal).

#### VPA

As with HPA, the VPA also monitors the metrics of the cluster and updates the limits of the pod accordingly.

VPA does not come buil-tin with Kubernetes. We must deploy it manyally. from the Kubernetes repository.

The YAML file will deploy the following pods:

- vpa-admission-controller
- vpa-recommender
- vpa-updater

The recommender monitors the metrics, and sends the data to the updater, the updater checks which pods are running with sub-optimal settings and evicts the ones that are not compliant. Then, the admission controller intervenes and updates the resource limits of those pods.

There is no imperative way for this so here is an example of VPA:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v2
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-vpa
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Auto"
  resourcePolicy:
    containerPolicies:
      - containerName: "my-app"
        minAllowed:
          cpu: "250"
        maxAllowed:
          cpu: "2"
        controlledResources: ["cpu"]
```

The `.spec.updatePolicy.updateMode` can take the following values:

- Off - Only recommends
- Initial - Onlhy changes on pod creation. Not later
- Recreate - Evicts pods if usage goes beyond range
- Auto - Updates existing pods to recommended numbers. For now this behaves similar to Recreate. But when support for "In-place Update of PodResouces" is available that mode will be preferred

To view the recommendations run `kubectl describe vpa my-app-vpa`.

## Cluster Maintenance

### OS Upgrade

The safest way to prepare the node for an upgrade that will make it go down longer than the pod eviction timeout, we need to first drain the node with `kubectl drain node-1`. The pods will be recreated on other nodes. The drain command wil cordon the node, which means the node is unschedulable.

Now we perform our upgrade tasks and reboot the node. After reboot, it is still unschedulable. We now need to uncordon it with `kubectl uncordon node-1` so the pods can be scheduled on it again.

We can also cordon a node manually with `kubectl cordon node-1`. Running this command without `drain` it just marks the node as unschedulable without evicting the pods from it.

### Kubernetes Upgrade

Usually all control plane components should have the same version. But there are cases where they can be at different versions under certain conditions. Since the `kube-apiserver` is the main component, none of other components should be at a newer version. Controller Manager and Kube Scheduler can be at one minor version older.

The only exception is `kubectl` which can be one minor version higher, same version or one minor version lower than the `kube-apiserver`.

**When should we upgrade:** Kubernetes supports 3 minor versions at a time. At the writing of this material, the current version is 1.32 so the supporter versions are: 1.32, 1.31, and 1.30.

**The recommended approach is to upgrade one minor version at a time. So do not skip versions.**

There are multiple ways to upgrade your cluster:

- Cloud providers will help you with this process
- If you deployed the cluster with `kubeadm` there are two commands:
  - `kubeadm upgrade plan`
  - `kubeadm upgrade apply`
- If you installed the cluster manually, well, this is the hard way in which you must upgrade each component manually

**For `kubeadm` deployed clusters, first you need to upgrade the kubeadm utility to match the version of Kubernetes you want to upgrade to.**

The first node that must pe upgraded is the Master node. During this time, the control plane will become briefly unavailable. Do not worry, the apps on the worker nodes will still keep running if there are no other issues with the pods (there is no component available to recreate or scale the pods).

The next are the worker nodes. The recommended way is one at a time.

Another strategy, if available, is to add new nodes to the cluster and remove the old nodes once the new ones are in place.

**Never upgrade the master nodes to be more than one minor version higher than the worker nodes!**

Let's write a bash script for the master node to upgrade from 1.11 to 1.12 (assume we are root):

```bash
apt upgrade -y kubeadm=1.12.0-00
kubeadm upgrade apply v1.12.0
apt upgrade -y kubelet=1.12.0-00 # Optional, only if you have kubelet on master node
systemctl restart kubelet # Optional, only if you have kubelet on master node
```

For each worker node it goes like this:

```bash
kubectl drain node-1
apt upgrade -y kubeadm=1.12.0-00
kubeadm upgrade apply v1.12.0
apt upgrade -y kubelet=1.12.0-00
kubeadm upgrade node config --kubelet-version v1.12.0
systemctl restart kubelet
kubectl uncordon node-1
```

### Backup and Restore Methods

#### Resource Configurations

Usually all resource definitions are being deployed using the declarative method. This is usually kept in a git repository so backup is mostly done through the repository.

But there are some cases where users do not use the declarative way and will generate resources imperative way without documentation.

So the best way to ensure that all resource configurations are being backed up is to generate them with the kubectl command or by directly interacting with the `kube-apiserver`.

```bash
kubectl get all --all-namespaces -o yaml > all-deploy-services.yaml
```

#### ETCD Cluster

We can use the snapshot feature of `etcdctl` command to save the data into a file:

```bash
etcdctl \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  snapshot save /backup/etcd-snapshot.db
```

We can view the status of the command by running `etcdctl snapshot status snapshot.db`.

There is another way in offline mode. This copies the etcd backend database and WAL files to the target location:

```bash
etcdutl backup \
  --data-dir /var/lib/etcd \
  --backup-dir /backup/etcd-backup
```

To restore it, run the following steps:

```bash
systemctl stop kube-apiserver
etcdctl snapshot restore snapshot.db --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup
# or
etcdutl snapshot restore /backup/etcd-snapshot.db --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-restored
# update the etcd.service file to point to the new etcd database path
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl etcd restart
systemctl kube-apiserver restart
```

**`etcdutl backup` performs a raw file-level copy of etcd’s data and WAL files without needing etcd to be running.**

## Security

### Security Primitives

Everything starts with secure nodes. Security of underlying nodes is quite important since if one of the nodes is compromised, almost everything is compromised.

The first line of defense when it comes to Kubernetes is `kube-apiserver`.

### Authentication

Kubernetes does not manage user accounts natively. It relies on an external source like a file with user details or certificates or a third party  service, like LDAP to manage these users.

Kubernetes can manage Service Accounts though.

The `kube-apiserver` authenticates each user before processing the commands it sents via either the `kubectl` command or directly through the API.

It does that by using an authentication mechanism. The list of available mechanisms is below:

- Static Password File
- Static Token File
- Certificates
- Identity Services (LDAP, Kerberos, etc.)

#### Basic Auth

We can define a list of users and passwords in a CSV file and then configure it on the `kube-apiserver` process with `--basic-auth-file=user-details.csv`.

Similarly we can use a token instead of a user and password. Like before, configure it with `--token-auth-file`.

**Basic Auth was deprecated since v1.19.**

#### TLS Certificates

Components that act as a server in Kubernetes are `kube-apiserver`, `etcd`, `kubelet`. When you connect to them, you will do it via HTTPS, so they expose a certificate.

Now, when we connect to the `kube-apiserver`, we have a client certificate and key to authenticate our request. The same applies for the `kube-scheduler`, `kube-controller-manager`, and `kube-proxy` when they connects to the `kube-apiserver`.

The `kube-apiserver` it self uses a client certificate and key when it connects to `etcd`. It also connects to the `kubelet` using a client certificate and key. The `kube-apiserver` can use the same client certificate for both `etcd` and `kubelet` connections.

All these certificates are signed by the Certificate Authority of the cluster. Ideally, there must be two CAs at the cluster level, one for the certificates of the components of the cluster and another one for `etcd`, but one CA will do the job.

To generate certificates there are multiple tools that we can use: easyrsa, openssl, cfssl.

We will use `openssl` for this course.

- **Generate the CA certificate**:
  - Generate the key with `openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048`
  - Then we need to generate a CSR with `openssl req -new -key ca.key -subj "/CN=KUBERNETES-CA" -out ca.csr`
  - Now we need to sign the certificate with the key `openssl x509 -req -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt`
- **Generate client certificates**:
  - Generate the key with `openssl genrsa -out admin.key 2048`
  - Generate CSR: `openssl req -new -key admin.key -subj "/CN=kube-admin/O=system:masters" -out admin.csr`. The `system:masters` identifies the user using this certificate as the admin by using the `masters` group.
  - Sign the certificate with the CA key pair: `openssl x509 -req -in admin.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -out admin.crt`

We repeat the client certificates for all other components.

After the certificates creation, they are being placed in a `kube-config.yaml` file and will be used by the components that need them:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
  - cluster:
      certificate-authority: ca.crt
      server: https://kube-apiserver:6443
    name: kubernetes
kind: Config
users:
  - name: kubernetes-admin
    user:
      client-certificate: admin.crt
      client-key: admin.key
```

If you install the cluster manually (the hard way), you would need to generate and configure all certificates manually. Since most of the clusters are deployed with `kubeadm` or by cloud providers internal tools, the certificates are generated automatically.

To view the list of certificates that are being used by the `kube-apiserver` take a look into the manifests file of the server `cat /etc/kubernetes/kube-apiserver.yaml`. and look at the command options. You can do the same for all other components.

The CA certificates must be stored on a CA server, which is basically a regular server containing the CA files. We then use this server to sign all other certificates.

Commonly, the master nodes has the role of the CA server. To avoid generating the certificates manually, we can use the certificates API of the master node.

Here are the steps on how to use the certificates API:

- The new user generates its key and CSR as presented before and sends the CSR to the Administrator
- The Administrator generates a certificate signing request definition file that looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
kind: CertificateSignRequest
metadata:
  name: jane
spec:
  expirationSeconds: 600
  usages:
    - digital signature
    - key encipherment
    - server auth
  request: lgaiejnrflsdkfj423kjh3nlk2j3h # The csr in base64 format
```

- The admin runs `kubectl apply -f new-request.yaml` which creates the object.
- To view the request run `kubectl get csr`
- To aprove the request run `kubectl certificate aprove jane`
- To view the aproved certificate run `kubectl get csr jane -o yaml` and decode it
- Share the certificate with the user

All the certificates operations are being carried out by the controller manager.

#### Kube Config

The `kubectl` command requires certificates and keys to present to the `kube-apiserver` in order to execute the commands. They can be passed as CLI arguments, but to avoid using them opn every command, we create a `kube-config.yaml` file that the `kubectl` command reads and applies the settings automatically.

By default it will look for the file in `$Home/.kube/config` file.

The config file has 3 sections:

- Clusters: Define the clusters available
- Contexts: Defines which user will connect to which cluster
- Users: Define the users available

An example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
current-context: my-kube-admin@my-kube-playground # Default context
clusters:
  - name: my-kube-playground
    cluster:
      certificate-authority: ca.crt # or use certificate-authority-data: {{ certificate in base64 }}
      server: https://localhost:6443
contexts:
  - name: my-kube-admin@my-kube-playground
    context:
      cluster: my-kube-playground
      user: my-kube-admin
      namespace: finance # Optional, you can use specific namespaces if not set by -n in kubectl command
users:
  - name: my-kube-admin
    user:
      client-certificate: admin.crt
      client-key: admin.key
```

To view the current config file run `kubectl config view`. If you want to use another config file, run `kubectl config view --kubeconfig=my-custom-config`.

To use another context run `kubectl config use-context prod-user@production`. **This will update the kube config file.**

#### API Groups

There are multiple API endpoints available in Kubernetes:

- `/metrics`
- `/healthz`
- `/version`
- `/api`
- `/apis`
- `/logs`

We will focust on the API endpoints that handle the cluster functionality. `/api` and `/apis`.

`/api` is the core API and this is where the core functionality exists such as `pods, endpoints, namespaces, etc.

`/apis` is the named group apis. These are better organised, and with time, the core functionalities will be migrated here. It handles apps, extensions, networking.k8s.io, etc. (known as API groups). Within `/apis/apps/v1` we have deployments, replicasets, statefulsets, etc. (known as resources).

Each resource has actions such as get, list, create, delete, etc.

To make it easier to interact with the API directly (via `curl`) usually you need to run `kubectl proxy` command which will start a Kubectl Proxy service that will expose the API without you needing to use authentication with each `curl` request.

### Authorization

There are multiple authorization mechanisms in Kubernetes:

- Node
- ABAC - Attribute Based Access Controls
- RBAC - Role Based Access Controls
- WebHook - External tools like Open Policy Agent

There are also two authorization modes (configured on the `kube-apiserver`) :

- AlwaysAllow (default)
- AlwaysDeny

We can set the value of `authorization-mode` to one of the modes or to one or multiple authorization mechanisms. They will be applied in the order you place them. If the first denies the action, it will go to the next one and so on.

#### Role Based Access Controls (RBAC)

To create a role, we need to create a role definition file:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: developer
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["list", "get", "create", "delete", "update"]
    resourceNames: ["blue","orange"] # Optional, more granular permissions on pods. Perform actions only for blue and orange pods.
```

We can then run `kubectl create -f developer-role.yaml` to create the role.

To link the user to the role we need to create a new object named Role Binding:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: devuser-developer-binding
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: dev-user
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: developer
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

We create it the same way with `kubectl create -f devuser-developer-binding.yaml`.

**If not specified otherwise, the role will be created on the default namespace.**

Quick commands:

- `kubectl get roles`
- `kubectl get rolebindings`
- `kubectl describe role developer`
- `kubectl describe rolebindings devuser-developer-binding`

You can also check if you have proper permissions before running a command with `kubectl auth can-i {{ verb }} {{ resource }}`. As an example `kubectl auth can-i create deployments`.

As an admin, you can also impersonate a user `kubectl auth can-i create deployments --as dev-user`.

#### Cluster Roles

Resources can also be categorised two ways:

- Namespaced resources (pods, deployments, roles, etc.)
- Cluster Scoped resources (nodes, clusterroles, PV, namespaces, etc.)

We can check the resource types by running `kubectl api-resources --namespaced=[true/false]`.

Since the Roles created before were targeted as namespaced resources, for Cluster Scoped resources we use `clusterroles` and `clusterrolenbindings`.

A cluster role looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: cluster-administrator
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["nodes"]
    verbs: ["list", "get", "create", "delete", "update"]
```

To create a Cluster Role Binding:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: cluster-admin-role-binding
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: cluster-admin
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-administrator
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Cluster Roles are not limited to the Cluster Scoped resources. If you allocate a cluster role for a pod resource, it will be made available for all namespaces not only for one, as is with the regular role.

### Service Accounts

An example of a usecase for Service Accounts is a Prometheus app that queries the Kubernetes API for the metrics. Since it is not a regular user, it will use a service account.

When we create a service account, Kubernetes will also create a token for the service account and will store it as a secret which is linked to the service account.

Each namespace has a default service account. For every new pod on that namespace, the token is automatically mounted as a volume inside the pod.

Since that service account is quite limited, we can use another one by adding `.spec.serviceAccountName` to the pod definition file.

You may choose not to mount the service accounts automatically by configuring `.spec.automountServiceAccountToken` and set it to `false`.

In version 1.22, the token request API was introduced as part of the Kubernetes enhancement proposal 1205, that aimed to introduce a mechanism for provisioning Kubernetes service account tokens that are more secure and scalable via an API. So tokens generated by the token request API are audience bound. They're time bound, and object bound, and hence are more secure.

With version 1.24, a change was made where when you create a service account, it no longer automatically creates a secret or a token access secret. So you must run `kubectl create token dashboard-sa`, to generate a token for that service account if you needed one. And it will then print that token on screen. Now, if you copy that token, and then if you try to decode this token, this time, you'll see that it has an expiry date defined.

The default value for the expiry date is 1 hour.

You can still do things the old way (although not recommended) by creating a secret with a specific annotation that links the secret to the service account:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
metadata:
  name: mysecretname
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: dashboard-sa
```

### Image Security

When we use private registries we must indicate Kubernetes on how to login into the registry and pull the image. To achieve that, we create a secret of type docker-registry which containst all the login data.

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
  --docker-server=private-registry.io \
  --docker-username=registry-user \
  --docker-password=registry-pass \
  --docker-email=registr-user@private-registry.io
```

Then we set the `.spec.imagePullSecrets[0].name` inside the pod definition to have the value `regcred`, which is the name of our secret.

### Security Contexts

As we know about Docker containers, there are some capabilities that we can add or remove from the containers (such as NET_ADMIN). We can apply that to Kubernetes also. We can do it at a container level or at a pod level. The pod level capabilities are inherited by all containers inside the pod.

For the pod level:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000 # Will run the containers as user with ID 1000
    capabilities:
      add:
        - MAC_ADMIN
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu
      image: ubuntu
      command:
        - "sleep"
        - "3600"
```

For the container level:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu
      image: ubuntu
      command:
        - "sleep"
        - "3600"
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000 # Will run the container as user with ID 1000
        capabilities:
        add:
          - MAC_ADMIN
```

### Network Policies

Network policies are used for defining which pods can acces what pods (since by default every pod can acces all other pods). Policies can be applied to Ingress or Egress traffic.

```yaml
apiVersion: networkin.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes: # Egress or Ingress traffic will not be allowed unless configured
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: api-pod
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 3306
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 192.168.0.0/24
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
```

For both Ingress and Egress we have 3 selectors:

- podSelector
- namespaceSelector
- ipBlock

Each item of the list `from` is considered to be a rule. We can have multiple selectors in a rule (AND condition). When there are multiple items it is considered an OR condition

Not all network solutions support network Policies:

- Solutions that spports network policie:
  - kube-router
  - calico
  - romana
  - weave-net
- Solutions that do not support network policies:
  - flannel


### Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

Let's imagine a case where we want to deploy a new type of resoure that is not defined already in Kubernetes. We will use an example of a resource that books a flight from a city to another in which we set the number of people.

The resource definition file looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: flights.com/v1
kind: FlightTicket
metadata:
  name: my-flight-ticket
spec:
  from: Bucharest
  to: London
  number: 2
```

There is no API endpoint in Kubernetes for flights.com/v1 and neither a kind of FlightTicket. For this, we need to create a Custom Resource Definition.

The CRD definition file would look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: flighttickets.flight.com
spec:
  scope: Namespaced
  group: flights.com
  names:
    kind: FlightTicket
    singular: flightticket
    plural: flighttickets
    shortnames:
      - ft
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true # Only one version can have storage: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                from:
                  type: string
                to:
                  type: string
                number:
                  type: integer
                  minimum: 1
                  maximum: 10
```

The definitions above will create the resources in `etcd` but they don't do anything else since we do not have a controller for them.

We need to create a custom controller so the definitions will actually do something.

To create a controller we need to write some actual code. Kubernetes recommends using GO as a programming language to write custom controllers. They do that because there is a library provided by them to create a controller at <https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller>.

This provides a framework in which you change the logic to our needs and then deploy the controller inside Kubernetes.

### Kubernetes Operators

Custom Controllers and CRDs can be packaged under a single resource type named Operator. An example is the ETCD Operator which deploys the ETCD Cluster, ETCD Controller and other auxiliary tools to backup and restore the ETCD cluster.

## Storage

### Container Storage Interface (CSI)

As with CRI, there is also a component that allows Kubernetes to integrate with multiple storage solutions named CSI.

### Volumes

In Kubernetes, we can create volumes just like with docker compose.

```yaml
...
kind: Pod
...
spec:
  containers:
    - image: alpine
      ...
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /opt # Inside the container
          name: data-volume
  volumes:
    - name: data-volume
      hostPath:
        path: /data # On host
        type: Directory
```

`hostPath` is not recommended to be used on multi node clusters, which, in some cases, will lead to data inconcistencies because the container will use the local storage of the node. Not even when the directory on the host is a shared volume (NFS or SMB). When we have a shared volume, Kubernetes has a storage driver for that (at least for NFS).

### Persistent Volumes

A Persistent Volume is a cluster wide pool of storage volumes configured by an administrator to be used by users when deploying applications on the cluster.

The applications will request storage from this pool using Persistent Volume Claims (PVC).

To create a persistent volume:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-vol1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce # Supported values: ReadOnlyMany, ReadOnlyOnce, ReadWriteMany
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  hostPath: # You can use various storage solutions
    path: /tmp/data
```

Volume claims are bound 1 to 1 with the persistent volume so we cannot have a two volume claims on a volume even if the initial claim doesn't use the entire volume.

We can filter out available volumes by using the same principles of labels and selector and/or access modes, storage classes, etc.

To create a persistent volume claim:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: myclaim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Mi
```

When we delete a PVC, the default action is to retain the persistent volume. No other PVC will be able to use the volume. We can change that by setting `.spec.persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy` to other options in PV definition file. Options are:

- Retain
- Delete
- Recycle

Inside the Pod definition file we set the `.spec.volumes[0].persistentVolumeClaim.claimName` to the name of the PVC in order to use the underlying volume inside our pod.

### Storage Classes

When we use remote storage for our PVCs they must already be created. There is a way to provision the storage on remote storage solutions upon the resource creation in Kubernetes. We use a Storage Class object for that.

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: google-storage
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-standard
  replication-type: none
```

In this case the PV definition file is no longer needed. We can configure the `.spec.storageclassName` option in PVC definition file and it will automatically provision the storage.

## Networking

### Container Networking Interface (CNI)

Kubernetes CNI (Container Network Interface) is like the networking rulebook for containers in a Kubernetes cluster.

Think of it this way: When you have a bunch of containers running on different computers (nodes), they need to talk to each other. CNI is the standard that tells Kubernetes how to set up networking so containers can communicate.

Here's what CNI does:

- **Creates container networks** - When a new pod (group of containers) starts up, CNI plugins automatically give it an IP address and connect it to the network.
- **Handles the plumbing** - It sets up virtual network interfaces, routing rules, and bridges so traffic flows between containers, even across different machines.
- **Pluggable system** - Different CNI plugins (like Calico, Flannel, or Weave) handle networking differently. Some focus on simplicity, others on security features like network policies.
- **Consistent interface** - Kubernetes doesn't need to know the networking details. It just tells the CNI plugin "set up networking for this pod" and the plugin handles the specifics.

Without CNI, containers would be isolated islands that can't communicate. CNI is the bridge system that connects them all together in a predictable way, whether they're on the same machine or scattered across a data center.

Some popular CNI plugins are:

- **Flannel** - Simple overlay networking
- **Calico** - Network policies and routing
- **Weave Net** - Mesh networking
- **Cilium** - eBPF-based with advanced features

When Kubernetes runs a docker container, it will run it inside the `none` network then it will invoke the plugins to attach a network interface to the container.

All CNI plugins are installed in `/opt/cni/bin`.

Configuration files are usually stored inside `/etc/cni/net.d` directory.

CNI plugins can also be deployed as pods and daemon sets.

### DNS in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes we deploy a DNS server named CoreDNS as a deployment.

The CoreDNS has a set of plugins which allows integrations with various tools. One of the plugins is Kubernetes. With the Kubernetes plugin we configure the root domain and some other settings.

The CoreDNS monitors the cluster and every time a new pod is created it adds a record in the DNS table.

Also, when a pod is created, the IP of the CoreDNS service is configured automatically to the pod so all pods will use the same DNS server. The configuration file for this is `/etc/resolv.conf` inside the containers.

The root domain of the Kubernetes cluster is `cluster.local`. The table below displays how a DNS record gets built:

|Hostname|Namespace|Type|Root|IP|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|web-service|apps|svc|cluster.local|10.107.37.188|
|10-244-2-5|apps|pod|cluster.local|10.244.2.5|
|10-244-1-5|default|pod|cluster.local|10.244.1.5|

Pods do not get a DNS record automatically. We need to manually specify that in the CoreDNS configuration and when they get a DNS record is the IP of the pod where the dots are replaced by dashes for the hostname.

### Ingress

To expose the applications to the outside world can be achieved in multiple ways. We can do it with a NodePort directly, a cloud LoadBalancer, NodePort + an external Reverse Proxy, or we can automate this using the functionality of an Ingress Controller and the Ingress resource definition file.

Commonly, there are three ingress controllers that are being used:

- NGINX (supported and maintained by the Kubernetes project)
- HAProxy
- Traefik
- GCP HTTP(S) Load Balancer (Google - GCE) (supported and maintained by the Kubernetes project)
- Contour
- Istio

The ingress controllers are not built-in, they need to be deployed manually.

They are not just load balancers, they have extra functionality to monitor the Kubernetes cluster in order to facilitate the auto configuration of the ingress controller based on the ingress resource definition files it finds.

A basic NGINX Ingress Controller definition file looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress-controller
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: nginx-ingress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: nginx-ingress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-ingress-controller
          image: quay.io/kubernetes-ingress-controller/nginx-ingress-controller:0.21.0
          args:
            - /nginx-ingress-controller
            - --configmap=$(POD_NAMESPACE)/nginx-configration
          env:
            - name: POD_NAME
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.name
            - name: POD_NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
            - name: https:
              containerPort: 443
```

Extra configuration related to SSL, keepalive, error log paths are being placed inside a ConfigMap.

We also need a service for that deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      protocol: tcp
      name: http
    - port: 443
      targetPort: 443
      protocol: tcp
      name: https
    selector:
      name: nginx-ingress
```

We also need a Service Account with the proper roles and roles bindings so the controller can monitor the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress-serviceaccount
```

To configure an Ingress resource, we have the following definition file:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-wear
spec:
  backend:
    serviceName: wear-service # The traffic is routed to the services not directly to the pods
    servicePort: 80
```

The example above is the most basic example of an ingress definition file. Usually you want to route traffic based on incoming rules (such as a domain or a domain path) to specific services:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-wear-watch
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /wear
            backend:
              serviceName: wear-service # The traffic is routed to the services not directly to the pods
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /watch
            backend:
              serviceName: watch-service
              servicePort: 80
```

If we run `kubectl describe ingress ingress-wear-watch` we will notice an item named `Default backend`. If the user accessing the app doesn't use a URL matched by one of the rules, it will be redirected to a default page (you need to deploy that service).

We can also configure domain name rules in combination with paths:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-wear-watch
spec:
  rules:
    - host: wear.my-online-store.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              serviceName: wear-service # The traffic is routed to the services not directly to the pods
              servicePort: 80
    - host: watch.my-online-store.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              serviceName: watch-service
              servicePort: 80
```

### Gateway API

Ingress has some limitations. It does not offer support for:

- Multi-tenancy
- Namespace Isolation
- No RBAC for Features
- No Resource Isolation

There is no native support for more advanced routing features such as:

- TCP/UDP routing
- Traffic splitting/weighting
- Header manipulation
- Authentication
- Rate limiting
- Redirects
- Rewriting
- Middleware
- WebSocker support
- Custom error pages
- Session affinity
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

To achieve some of these functionalities with Ingress, we must configure a set of complex annotations. Which can be hard to understand and maintain over time. Those annotations also vary from an ingress controller to another.

The Gateway API is a new generation of ingress controller that bhas more advanced functionality built-in.

There are 3 components of the Gateway API, usually configured by different teams:

- GatewayClass - defines what the underlying network infrastructure would be, such as the NGINX, Traefik or other load balancers. Configured by Infrastructure Providers
- Gateway - instances of the GatewayClass. Configured by cluster operators
- Route types - configured by application developers

To configure a GatewayClass:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
  name: example-class
spec:
  controllerName: example.com/gateway-controller
```

For the Gateway object we have:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: example-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: example-class
  listeners:
    - name: http
      protocol: HTTP
      port: 80
```

An example of the HTTPRoute:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: example-httproute
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: example-gateway
  hostnames:
    - "www.example.com"
  rules:
    - matches:
      - path:
          type: PathPrefix
          value: /login
      backendRefs:
        - name: example-svc
          port: 8080
```

Available route types are:

- HTTPRoute
- TLSRoute
- TCPRoute
- UDPRoute
- GRPCRoute

An example of how it used to be with annotations is to redirect regular HTTP traffic to HTTPS:

- Ingress version:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: secure-app
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: "true"
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - secure.example.com
      secretName: tls-secret
```

- Gateway version:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: secure-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: example-gc
  listeners:
    - name: https
      port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
      tls:
        mode: Terminate # Terminate TLS at gateway, no tls connection will be forwarded to the service in this case
        certificateRefs:
          - kind: Secret
            name: tls-secret
      allowedRoutes:
        kinds:
          - kind: HTTPRoute
```

The Gateway configurations and Routes configured above will work with any controller.

There are a lot of controller providers that implemented the Gateway Controller standard: EKS, Azure Application Gateway for Containers, GKE, HAProxy Kubernetes Ingress Controller, Envoy Gateway, Istio, NGINX Gateway Fabric, Traefik Proxy, WSO2 APK, and many others.

## Design a Kubernetes Cluster

Tere are multiple scenarios we need to consider when we design a Kubernetes cluster. We first need to think what is the purpose of the cluster:

- Education
  - Minikube
  - Single node cluster with kubeadm/GCP/AWS
- Development and testing
  - Multi-node cluster with a single master and multiple workers
  - Setup using kubeadm or quick provisioning on GCP, AWS or AKS
- Production
  - Highly Available Multi-Node Cluster with multiple master nodes

Then we need to decide on what type of nodes do we want to deploy the cluster on:

- VMs
- Bare Metal
- x86
- ARM

In large clusters it is a common practice to separate the ETCD nodes from the master nodes.

The master nodes can take multiple architectures:

- Active-Active - With an external load balancer in front of them
- Active-Standby - This involves a leader election process at the `kube-controller-manager` level

Since ETCD is using RAFT protocol for synchronisation of data, the ETCD cluster must be at least 3 to really obtain HA. The RAFT protocol uses a quorum based election for a leader and the formula for the quorum is `N/2+1`. If `N/2` is `x.5` then only `x` is considered. An example of quorum from clusters containing 1 to 7 nodes is presented below:

|Instance|Quorum|Number of nods allowed to lose|
|---|---|---|
|1|1|0|
|2|2|0|
|3|2|1|
|4|3|1|
|5|3|2|
|6|4|2|
|7|4|3|

It is optimal to use an odd number of etcd nodes since, in case of a network segmentation procedure, we will continue to have enough quorum.

## Helm

### Helm Basics

Managing Kubernetes definition files (manifests) is a tedious task even for the simplest apps.

Helm comes into help to organise the deployment of the definition files to properly launch our application.

It can be considered a package manager for Kubernetes (it acts like one even though it is not really a package manager).

It is composed of a YAML file containing the customization values (imagine it like a predefined .env file for docker-compose.yml) and templates of definition files for the Kubernetes resources.

Helm reads the `values.yaml` file and replaces the templated variables inside the definition files and then deploys the application.

It also keeps track of what we changed in a configuration and can perform rollbacks.

**Helm removes the micromanagement of each Kubernetes object from us.**

Before installing Helm, we need to have a fully functional Kubernetes environment with `kubectl` installed and ready to go.

For installation, follow the guide for your OS from [Helm installation instructions page](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install).

*When installing helm with `snap` and want to use the kubeconfig file from your host, use `--classic` option so the snap package can have less restrictions on your host.*

You must be aware that Helm has multiple versions. The latest version is v3. There are breaking changes between versions so pay attention when you download Helm charts from the internet.

- v1.0 - February 2016
- v2.0 - November 2016
- v3.0 - November 2019

In v2.0, when we ran a Helm command, we had to communicate to an "agent" on the Kubernetes nodes named "Tiller" which then performed our actions. Tiller ran in *"God"* mode on Kubernetes cluster creating a security risk. **In Helm 3, Tiller no longer exists, and Helm connects to the Kubernetes API directly.**

Also, Helm 3 uses a three-way Strategic Merge Patch to upgrade an application. It compares the current version (what we changed) with the previous version and with the live version and decides what to change. In Helm 2, each update was a new revision of the old application. A rollback created a new revision with the initial version but it was still let's say rev.3. **This difference allows us to make changes outside of helm and still be able to update the application with helm later on.**

There are many changes in Helm 3, they optimised a lot of procedures to improve reliability of the tool.

### Helm components

- **`helm` CLI** - Perform helm actions
- **Charts** -  a collection of files, they contain all the instructions that Helm needs to know to be able to create the collection of objects that you need in your Kubernetes cluster
- **Releases** - a single installation of an application using a Helm chart. Within each release, you can have multiple revisions, and each revision is like a snapshot of the application. Every time a change is made to the applications, such as an upgrade of the image or change of replicas or configuration objects, a new revision is created
- **Online Chart Repository** - Is the equivalent of Docker Registry, but it contains the template files of Helm charts. Most providers, even they have their own repositories, list their charts on `artifacthub.io`
- **Metadata** - Helm stores metadata about the state of changes (and history of changes) as a Secret in Kubernetes cluster

### Helm Charts

Helm is an automation tool, but what and how it automates stuff?

Let's take the example of a basic application, besides a deployment file and a service file it has:

- values.yaml - customization values
- Chart.yaml - Information about the chart itself and other data related to the chart

An example of a Chart.yaml file is presented below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2 # Helm 2 has v1 or nothing, Helm 3 has v2
appVersion: 5.8.1 # Version of the application that is inside the app (e.g. wordpress version) is for informational purposes only
version: 12.1.27 # Version of the chart itself
name: wordpress # Name of the chart
description: Web publishing platform
type: application # Application is default. It can also be a library. The library is for other components that helps build the chart
dependencies: # Various dependencies that need to be deployed before deploying this chart e.g. mariadb database.
  - condition: mariadb.enabled # taken from the values.yml
    name: mariadb
    repository: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
    version: 9.x.x
    ...
keywords:
  - application
  - blog
  - wordpress
maintainers:
  - email: ""
    name: ""
home: "" # Usually the git repository URL
icon: "" # The icon of the app (URL)
```

The directory structure of the chart looks like this:

- templates
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml
- values.yaml
- Chart.yaml
- LICENSE
- README.md
- charts (directory with other charts that the current chart is dependent on)

### Helm Commands

Let's see how can we deploy a Wordpress website with Helm.

First, we go to ArtifactHub to get the information we need about the Wordpress Helm chart. Usually, there are a lot of information about the customisation options available and the instructions on how to install.

We can also use the `helm search` command from the CLI, but the web version is the preferred way.

Then we need to add the repository on our host with `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`

Then we install the helm chart by running `helm install my-release bitnami/wordpress`.

An application is deployed as a release, to list all releases run `helm list`.

To uninstall the app run `helm uninstall my-release`.

We deployed the application directly from the repository, with the default values. How do we customize the chart parameters in this case?

We have multiple options:

- Use the `--set` option to configure specific values (e.g. `--set wordpressBlogName="My Blog"`). But this gets complicated when there are a lot of values
- Create a custom `values.yaml` file and pass it to the command using `--values` argument
- Use the two step method:
  - Pull the helm chart to an archive on the disk with `helm pull bitnami/wordpress`, or add `--untar` to extract the contents on the fly
  - Edit the `values.yaml` file and then deploy it with `helm install my-release ./wordpress`.

**Almost every Helm Chart comes with default values. The values that we customize will override the ones in the default vales.yaml file but it will not override the entire file, only the specific variables that we mentioned.**

### Lifecycle Management in Helm

When running `helm list` we can see the list of releases but it won't tell too many details about each release.

For multiple details, we run `helm history {{ release name }}` and we get the history of upgrades, downgrades and other data about each step.

If something wen wrong, we can go back to previous revision using `helm rollback {{ release name }} {{ revision number }}`. It does not go back to revision you specified, it creates a new revision with the data of the revision you specified.

There might be extra stepts involved for more complex applications when you need to rollback. Usually the steps are included in the helm chart information.

**It doesn't cover file or directory data that may be created by our applications. Instead, Helm backs up and restores the declarations or manifest files of our Kubernetes objects. So for things that use persistent volumes or other forms of persistent data or something that is external, maybe like an external database, the rollback won't restore that data too.**

Helm uses [GO Templating language](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) for the mapping of values inside their templates from the `values.yaml` file.

## Kustomize

Kustomize is another tool that tries to help with the tedious task of managing definition files across multiple environments.

It has two concepts:

- base - Base configuration available for all environments
- overlays - Customizations that will be applied on specific environments

The directory structure looks like this:

- k8s
  - base
    - kustomization.yaml
    - nginx-deployment.yaml
    - service.yaml
    - redis-deployment.yaml
  - overlays
    - dev
      - kustomization.yaml
      - config-map.yaml
    - stg
      - kustomization.yaml
      - config-map.yaml
    - prod
      - kustomization.yaml
      - config-map.yaml

The base and overlay files will then be used to generate the final manifests.

Kustomize doesn't use a templating system like Helm and it has less features (no contitionals, loops, functions, hooks).

### Kustomization File

Kustomize will look for a `kustomization.yaml` file when deploying resources. This file contains two things:

- a list of all of the Kubernetes resources that will be managed by Kustomize
- Items that will be changed

```yaml
resources:
  - nginx-deployment.yaml
  - nginx-service.yaml

commonLabels:
  company: MyCompany
```

Now we need to build the manifests. We run `kustomize build k8s/`. It will output the definition files with the changes applied.

To actually deploy the resources, run `kustomize build k8s/ | kubectl apply -f -`.

There is another option directly with kubectl: `kubectl apply -k k8s/`.

To delete the resources we run the reverse commands `kustomize build k8s/ | kubectl delefe -f -`.

### Managing Directories

When there are a lot of definition files, we usually organise them into folders (e.g. db and api). There will be a `kustomization.yaml` file outside of these directories in which we mention the resources by using the relative path. The rest is the same as previously presented.

Another solution is to use a `kustomization.yaml` file for each directory in which we mention only the resources. Then the main `kustomization.yaml` file will mention the directories in which it will look for the other kustomization files.

### Transformers

Transformers are functionalities or configurations that modify Kubernetes resource manifests during the build process. They automate the application of changes across multiple YAML files, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort.

- Common Transformers (will be applied to all resources):
  - commonLabel - adds a label to all Kubernetes resources
  - namePrefix/Suffix - adds a common prefix-suffix to all  resource names
  - Namespace - adds a common namespace to all resources
  - commonAnnotations -adds an annotation to all resources

Image Transformers are another example of transformers. They are applied based on match of value. As an example, the following kustomization file will change all containers that use nginx image to haproxy image:

```yaml
images:
  - name: nginx
    newName: haproxy
    newTag: 2.4 # We can also target the tag of the image
```

### Patches

Kustomize uses patches to provide a more *surgical* approach to targeting one or more specific sections in a Kubernetes resource.

To create a patch you need 3 parameters:

- Operation type (add, remove, replace)
- Target
  - Kind
  - Version/Group
  - Name
  - Namespace
  - LabelSelector
  - AnnotationSelector
- Value

There are multiple types of patches.

A JSON 6902 inline patch looks like this:

```yaml
patches:
  - target:
      kind: Deployment
      name: api-deployment
    patch: |-
      - op: replace
        path: /metadata/name
        value: web-deployment
```

An inline strategic merge patch looks like this:

```yaml
patches:
  - patch: |-
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        name: api-deployment
      spec:
        replicas: 5
```

We can use a separate file for our patches for both cases. We just mention the name of the file.

```yaml
patches:
  - replica-patch.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 5
```

### Overlays

Based on the structure of the directory presented in the introduction of this chapter, we have the base directory and overlays directory. The base directory has a kustomization file present. In overlays directories, we also have a kustomization file present.

The overlay kustomization file will provide patches for the base for specific environments (dev, stg, prod).

Inside the base kustomization file, we just import the resources. Inside the dev kustomization file, we have the patch, and the path to the base kustomization files we want to interact with.

```yaml
bases:
  - ../../base # relative path from the file
patch: |-
  - op: replace
    path: /spec/replicas
    value: 2
```

This patch will target all the resources loaded from the base kustomization file and will change their replicas to 2.

We can also have a new resource inside one of our overlays directories (e.g. grafana-deployment.yaml) which will deploy a new resource only for a specific environment.

### Components

Components provide the ability to define reusable pieces of configuration logic (resources + patches) that can be included in multiple overlays

Components are useful in situations where applications support multiple optional features that need to be enabled only in a subset of overlays (groups of overlays).

The components are placed inside a directory that sits alongside the base directory. We name this directory `components`.

There will be a directory inside components for each compoenent (e.g caching, db).

Each of these folders will have the kustomization file and the definition files.

An example of the kustomization file for a component looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component

resources:
  - postgres-depl.yaml

secretGenerator:
  - name: postgres-cred
    literals:
      - password=postgres123
patches:
  - deployment-patch.yaml
```

The overlays konfiguration file will include also the components:

```yaml
bases:
  - ../../base

components:
  - ../../components/db
```

## Troubleshooting

### Application Failures

Usually we can follow a standard procedure to troubleshoot applications:

- Check accesibility with `curl`
- Check the service configuration
- Check the pod itself. Make sure it works properly and there are no errors in the logs
- Check related applications (e.g. databse pods). Perform the same steps for them as well

### Control Plane Failures

- Check the status of nodes
- Check the status of pods (in `kube-system` namespace) or the SystemD services
- Check the kubelet on all nodes
- Check the logs of control plane components

### Worker Node Failures

We need to check if the node is ready with `kubectl get nodes`. If it is not ready, we can dig even more with `kuebctl describe node worker-1`.

There are multiple flags that can lead us in the right direction:

- OutOfDisk
- MemoryPressure
- DiskPressure
- PIDPressure
- Ready

We can also check the `kubelet` for possible issues or check the certificates with `openssl x509 -in /var/lib/kubelet/worker-1/crt`.

When the node fails to respond to the heartbeet, the status of the flags might be set to `Unknown`, indicating that there might be a connectivity issue.

## Other topics

### JSON Path

JsonPath uses special notation to represent nodes and their connections to adjacent nodes in a JsonPath path. There are two styles of notation: dot and bracket.

Both of the following paths refer to the same node from the above JSON document, which is the third element within the location field of creator node, that is a child of the jsonpath object belonging to tool under the root node.

- `$.tool.jsonpath.creator.location[2]` - Dot notation
- `$['tool']['jsonpath']['creator']['location'][2]` - Bracket notation

Other symbols:

- The `$` represents the root node
- `@` represents the current node
- `*` (wildcard) represents all items (e.g. `.location[*]` means all items in location array)

JsonPath also has functions that we can use at the end of a path to synthesize that path’s output expressions: `min()`, `max()`, `avg()`, `stddev()` and `length()`.

Finally, we have filters. These are boolean expressions to restrict returned lists of nodes to only those that calling methods need.

A few examples are equality (`==`), regular expression matching (`=~`), inclusion (`in`) and check for emptiness (`empty`). We mainly use filters for predicates.

More details on [JsonPath GitHub Page](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath)

### Advanced Kubectl Commands

We can use JsonPath to enhance the output of `kubectl` command.

By default, `kubectl` will not display the entire content it receives from the `kube-apiserver`. It will display only the minimum information requested in a pretty format. We can change that with JsonPath.

Let's say I want to see the CPU counts in a tabular format. The `-o wide` option won't help me enough.

To use the JsonPath with `kubectl`, we must follow the following steps:

- Know what command should give you the information required (`get pods` for pods, `get nodes` for nodes, etc.)
- Familiarize with the JSON output by adding `-o json` to the command. This will display all the data in JSON format
- Form the JsonPath query that will retrieve your data (e.g `.items[0].spec.containers[0].image`)
- Use the JsonPath with `kubectl` to filter the data: `kubectl get pods -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].image}'`.

**Note that the `$` from the beginning of JsonPath is not mandatory here. Also, when using `*` inside the JsonPath query, it will iterate over each item of the list.**

We can also use multiple queries by concatenating expressions `kubectl get pods -o=jsonpath='{...}{...}'`. We can also add a new line between the parameters with `'{...} {"\n"} {...}'`

We can also use loops like this `'{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.status.capacity.cpu}{"\n"}{end}'`

We can add custom columns so we better structure our output with `-o=custom-columns=<Column Name>:<JSON Path>`. An example looks like this `kubectl get nodes -o=custom-columns=NODE:.metadata.name`. It will iterate over each item and print it's name and display it under the NODE column. Multiple values can be separated by a comma.

We can also sort items by using JsonPath by using `--sort-by=<JSON Path>`. E.g.: `kubectl get nodes --sort-by=.metadata.name`.

## Certification Tips

As you might have seen already, it is a bit difficult to create and edit YAML files. Especially in the CLI. During the exam, you might find it difficult to copy and paste YAML files from browser to terminal. Using the kubectl run command can help in generating a YAML template. And sometimes, you can even get away with just the kubectl run command without having to create a YAML file at all. For example, if you were asked to create a pod or deployment with specific name and image you can simply run the kubectl run command.

Use the below set of commands and try the previous practice tests again, but this time try to use the below commands instead of YAML files. Try to use these as much as you can going forward in all exercises

- Create an NGINX Pod
  - `kubectl run nginx --image=nginx`
- Generate POD Manifest YAML file (`-o yaml`). Don't create it(`--dry-run`)
  - `kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml`
- Create a deployment
  - `kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx`
- Generate Deployment YAML file (`-o yaml`). Don't create it(`--dry-run`)
  - `kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml`
- Generate Deployment YAML file (`-o yaml`). Don’t create it(`--dry-run`) and save it to a file.
  - `kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml`
- Make necessary changes to the file (for example, adding more replicas) and then create the deployment.
  - `kubectl create -f nginx-deployment.yaml`
- In k8s version 1.19+, we can specify the --replicas option to create a deployment with 4 replicas.
  - `kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --replicas=4 --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml`

<https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/conventions/>

To create a namespace run `kuebctl create namespace {namespace name}`.

Imperative commands:

- `kubectl run --image=nginx nginx`
- `kubectl create deplyment --image=nginx nginx`
- `kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80`
- `kubectl edit deployment nginx`
- `kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=5`
- `kubectl set image deployment nginx nginx=nginx:1.18`

**Remember**, you **CANNOT** directly edit (by using `kubectl edit`) specifications of an existing POD other than the below:

- spec.containers[*].image
- spec.initContainers[*].image
- spec.activeDeadlineSeconds
- spec.tolerations

With Deployments you can easily edit any field/property of the POD template. Since the pod template is a child of the deployment specification,  with every change the deployment will automatically delete and create a new pod with the new changes. So if you are asked to edit a property of a POD part of a deployment you may do that simply by running the command: `kubectl edit deployment my-deployment`

To save the current configuration of a pod into a YAML file run `kubectl get pod elephant -o yaml > elephant.yml`.

You must verify your work yourself. For example, if the question is to create a pod with a specific image, you must run the the kubectl describe pod command to verify the pod is created with the correct name and correct image.

When troubleshooting, always inspect the logs whether they are service logs (with `journalctl`) or container logs (with `kubectl logs`).
